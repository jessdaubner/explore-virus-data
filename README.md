# Explore Virsus Data
Quick script to explore security scan data similar to VirusTotal.

## Getting Started 
1. Install the project's dependencies using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with your preferred tool (poetry, pipenv, pdm, venv, pip, etc.). 
2. Once you have an active virtual environment, the script can be run as follows:
   ```
   python process_virus_scan_data.py <data_dir> <save_output>
   ```
   where `data_dir` is where the `*.json` virus scan data is available locally and `save_output` is a boolean value that determines if the process results are saved.
